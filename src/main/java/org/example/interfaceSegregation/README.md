# Interface Segregation Principle

The interface segregation principle (ISP) states that no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know 
about the methods that are of interest to them. Such shrunken interfaces are also called role interfaces.
ISP is intended to keep a system decoupled and thus easier to refactor, change, and redeploy. 
ISP is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design, similar to the High Cohesion Principle of GRASP.
Beyond object-oriented design, ISP is also a key principle in the design of distributed systems in general and microservices in particular. 
ISP is one of the six IDEALS principles for microservice design.
