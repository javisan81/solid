# Liskov Substitution principle

It is based on the concept of "substitutability" â€“ a principle in object-oriented programming stating that an object 
(such as a class) may be replaced by a sub-object (such as a class that extends the first class) without breaking the 
program. It is a semantic rather than merely syntactic relation, because it intends to guarantee semantic 
interoperability of types in a hierarchy, object types in particular.
