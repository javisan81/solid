The SOLID ideas are

    The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."
        In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
    The Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
    The Liskov substitution principle: 
        "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."
    The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
    The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
